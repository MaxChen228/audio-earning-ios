59
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:25,815
It's

Now,

111
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:47,445
It

112
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:47,606
was

113
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:47,826
just

00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:48,347

124
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:52,173

125
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:52,454

132
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:54,917
It

133
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:55,097

134
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:55,319

But

And

00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:29,091
the

221
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:29,331
funny

222
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:29,591
part.

223
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:30,233
He

224
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:30,493

in

228
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:31,896
mind,

229
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:32,397
not

230
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:32,757
even

231
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:32,837
a

232
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:33,197
tiny

233
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:33,858
idea.

00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:34,260
Can

00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,459
you

236
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:34,980
imagine

237
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,141
the

238
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,542
pressure?

239
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,143
You're

240
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:36,183
a

241
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:36,504
young

242
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:36,884
writer

243
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:37,484
going

244
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:37,646

245
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:37,865
meet

246
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:38,025
your

00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:38,367
boss,

248
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:38,908
and

249
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:39,087
you

250
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:39,268

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,349
show.

254
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,212
So,

255
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:41,632

sometimes

264
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:45,138
used.

265
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:45,799
He

266
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:46,040

And

00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:49,045

276
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:49,406

00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:12,008

thought,

344
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:16,757
why

00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:20,782
like

00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:20,961
how

361
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:22,104
fell,

362
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:22,585
but

363
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:22,724
in

364
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:23,185

365
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:23,846
He

366
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:24,007
had

367
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:24,247
read

00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:24,326

Fall

00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:27,290

once,

381
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:29,715
but

382
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:30,194
twice.

383
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:30,955
So

was

387
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:32,679
bubbling

388
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:33,158

00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:33,340
him

390
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:33,560
by

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:33,659
the

392
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:33,980
time

393
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,140

400
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:37,585
Um,

401
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:38,205
it

402
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:38,385
was

403
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:39,127
contagious.

404
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:40,008

00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:45,895
A

00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:46,376

431
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:51,402
between

432
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:51,763
two

433
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:52,424
galactic

434
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:52,905
empires.

435
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:53,425
And

436
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:53,985
they

437
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:54,246
even

438
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:54,507
thought

439
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:54,586
of

440
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:54,667
a

441
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:54,866
new

442
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:55,527
science,

443
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:56,468
psycho

444
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:57,090
history.

445
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,669
This

446
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,091
science

447
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,311
could

448
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:58,771
predict

449
00:02:58,792 --> 00:02:58,972
the

450
00:02:59,111 --> 00:02:59,532
future

451
00:02:59,733 --> 00:02:59,772
of

452
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,493
many,

453
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:00,935
many

454
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:01,354
people

455
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:01,895
on

456
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:01,975
a

457
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:02,736
galactic

458
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:03,717
scale.

459
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:04,038
So,

460
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:04,300
on

461
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:04,760
August

462
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:04,901

463
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,823

464
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:07,006
he

465
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:07,427
started

466
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:07,807
writing

467
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:07,968
the

468
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:08,270
first

469
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,691
story,

470
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,252
calling

471
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:09,372
it

472
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:10,254
foundation.

473
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:11,116
In

474
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:11,257
it,

475
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:11,737
he

476
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:12,280
described

477
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,741
Harry

478
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:13,282
Selden,

479
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:13,582
the

480
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,665
psychohistorian.

481
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:15,587
Selden

482
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:15,908
set

483
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:16,049
up

484
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,430
two

485
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,012
special

486
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:17,954
foundations

487
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:18,194
at

488
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:18,616
different

489
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:18,956
ends

490
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:19,076
of

491
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:19,217
the

492
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:19,758
universe.

493
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,981
Why?

494
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:21,162
to

495
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:21,423
make

496
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:21,682
sure

497
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:21,903
that

498
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:22,084
a

499
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:22,564
second

500
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:23,105
empire

501
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:23,306
would

502
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:23,687
rise

503
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:23,888
in

504
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:24,147
just

505
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:24,588
1,000

506
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,510
years.

507
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:26,612
Otherwise,

508
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:26,954
it

509
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:27,133
would

510
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:27,354
take

511
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,056
30,000

512
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:28,796
years.

513
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:29,418
He

514
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:29,838
submitted

515
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:30,039
this

516
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,419
story

517
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,920
and

518
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,102
to

519
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:31,361
make

520
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:31,603
sure

521
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:32,104
Campbell

522
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:32,304
would

523
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:32,524
buy

524
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:32,865
more,

525
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:33,385
he

526
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:33,766
ended

527
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:33,866
it

528
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:34,187
on

529
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:34,228
a

530
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,109
cliffhanger.

531
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:35,751
He

532
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,070
really

533
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:36,391
wanted

534
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:36,512
to

535
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:36,932
force

536
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,394
Campbell

537
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:37,574
to

538
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:37,974
ask

539
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:38,194
for

540
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:38,295
a

541
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:38,695
second

542
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:39,578
story.

543
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:39,777
But

544
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:40,019
then,

545
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,639
he

546
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:40,939
ran

547
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,219
into

548
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,599
trouble.

549
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,140
When

550
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:42,260
he

551
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:42,641
started

552
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:42,801
the

553
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:43,201
second

554
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:43,603
story,

555
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:44,243
he

556
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:44,704
quickly

557
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:44,965
wrote

558
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:45,444
himself

559
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:45,985
into

560
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,205
an

561
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:46,787
impasse.

562
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:47,306
He

563
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:47,487
was

564
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:47,888
stuck.

565
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:48,389
The

566
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:48,769
series

567
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:49,270
almost

568
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:49,770
died

569
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:50,091
right

570
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,411
there,

571
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:51,171
but

572
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:51,532
a

573
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:51,953

574
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:52,554
Fred

00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:52,873
Pol,

576
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:53,514
helped

577
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:53,655
him

578
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:53,875
out.

579
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:54,515
Just

580
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:54,596
a

581
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,276
conversation

582
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:55,377
on

583
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:55,477
the

584

Bridge

586
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:56,658
and

587
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,058
Fred's

588
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:57,439
words

589
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,840
pulled

590
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:57,979
him

591
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:58,241
out

592
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:58,320
of

593
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,501
that

594
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,841
hole.

595
00:03:59,282 --> 00:03:59,382
The

596
00:03:59,442 --> 00:03:59,822
series

597
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,144
continued.

598
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:01,465
Let's

599
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:01,705
pause

600
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:01,884
here

601
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:02,086
for

602
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:02,165
a

603
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:02,485
moment

604
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:02,706
and

605
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:02,947
look

606
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:03,067
at

607
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:03,427
two

608
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:03,848
words

609
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,088
from

610
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:04,288
this

611
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:04,569
part

612
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:04,710
of

613
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:04,849
the

614
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,230
story.

615
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,192
First,

616
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:07,234
hastening.

617
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,719
H-A-S-T-E-N-I-N-G.

618
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:11,841
Asimov

619
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:12,162
was

620
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:12,923
hastening

621
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:13,163
to

622
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:13,304
his

623
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:13,623
meeting.

624
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:14,264
This

625
00:04:14,324 --> 00:04:14,545
means

626
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:15,768
G-Mong-Gun-Chu.

627
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:16,269
It

628
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:16,528
means

629
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,889
going

630
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,269
somewhere

631
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,571
very

632
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:18,011
quickly

633
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:18,312
in

634
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:18,391
a

635
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:18,752
hurry.

636
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:19,394
Can

637
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:19,533
you

638
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:19,894
imagine

639
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:20,295
yourself

640
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,137
hastening

641
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:21,317
to

642
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:21,697

The

667
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:36,442
it's

672
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:37,906

675
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:39,288
You're

676
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:39,788

677
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:40,730

684
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:42,834
So

685
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:43,314

691
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:45,678
but

692
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:45,899
then

693
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:46,399

700
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:49,478
So,

701
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:50,139
what's

702
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,298

We

714
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:54,783
